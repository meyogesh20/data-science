    "1. **Clarity in Visuals** 👀  \n",
    "   - Charts/graphs must be large enough & clearly labeled.  \n",
    "   - Test readability from different distances (like your audience).  \n",
    "   - Redesign if visuals are hard to see.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tell the Story, Not Just Data** 📖  \n",
    "   - Don’t overload slides with numbers.  \n",
    "   - Start with **key messages** → build the story → add supporting data.  \n",
    "   - Use data as **evidence**, not the centerpiece.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **One Point per Chart** 🎯  \n",
    "   - Avoid cluttered visuals (e.g., overloaded pie charts).  \n",
    "   - Stick with **one clear idea** per visualization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Eliminate Irrelevant Data** 🧹  \n",

    "\n",
    "## ✅ Best Practices\n",
    "- Focus on **clarity, simplicity, and relevance**.  \n",

    "- Ensure each visualization conveys **one insight**.  \n",
